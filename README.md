# Android-Wifi-Attendance
Why Attendance with Wi-Fi?
-> In the university attendance of the students is important but it’s time consuming process because it’s taken manually with pen and paper. Turn by turn students will raise their hand and professors have to mark their attendance in paper sheets
-> It will save the time of both Professors and Students.

How it Works?
-> Professors have to select the particular slot of lecture and turn on the Wi-Fi direction from the application
-> Don't need an application at the student side for an attendance, Student have to just on the Wi-Fi and Application will collect the nearby device IP address and will check from database and mark the attendance.
